## Introduction
Each year approximately 1.25 million people die as a result of traffic accidents. An additional 20 million to 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries and many become disabled as a result. Traffic injuries cause great economic losses to individuals, their families and entire nations. In this project, we will build a deep learning model that sends an alert to the nearest police station through street cameras. The generated model will be CNN, which we will find to be most suitable for our situation and for image detection.

## Data Description
This dataset was created to detect accidents in real-time from cctv footage. It contains frames captured from Youtube Videos involving acccidents.
Dataset is split into 3 folders - train, test and val.Each folder has Accident and Non Accident folders.
Consecutive frames of an accident are included in the dataset so the model can learn to differentiate between an accident and non accident. the source from:

## Quesion\need:
Our plan in the project is to:
* Find data that meets our goal.
* Build a deep learning model(CNN).
* Build a classification model.
* Need: This project will assist the General Traffic Department in responding quickly to traffic accidents, knowing how the accident occurred, identifying who cause the accident and taking the necessary measures against it.


## Tools Description
The main technologies and libraries that used are:
### Technologies:
*	Python
*	Jupyter Notebook
### Libraries:
* Pandas
*	Numpy
*	Matlibplot
*	Seaborn
*	SKlearn
*	keras
*	Tensorflow
and other Python libraries or tools will be used if needed.
