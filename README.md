# Traffic-Accident-Detection-Deep-Learning

## Introduction
Each year approximately 1.25 million people die as a result of traffic accidents. An additional 20 million to 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries and many become disabled as a result. Traffic injuries cause great economic losses to individuals, their families and entire nations. In this project, we will build a deep learning model that sends an alert to the nearest police station through street cameras. The generated model will be CNN, which we will find to be most suitable for our situation and for image detection.

## Approach
Our plan in the project is to:
* Find data that meets our goal.
* Build a deep learning model(CNN).
* Build a classification model.
